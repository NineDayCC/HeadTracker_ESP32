The transmitter and receiver only need to be paired once, and there is no need to repeat the pairing process afterward (OTA does not affect the existing pairing).

The pairing method is as follows:
1. Power on both the transmitter and receiver (order does not matter)
2. Press and hold the micro switch on the transmitter until you hear the buzzer start to beep intermittently
3. Press and hold the micro switch on the receiver to complete the pairing

After successful pairing, the transmitter will emit a long beep.
