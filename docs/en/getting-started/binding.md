The transmitter and receiver only need to be paired once, and there is no need to repeat the process afterward (OTA updates do not affect the existing pairing).

Follow these steps to pair them:
1. **Power on** both the transmitter and receiver (order does not matter).
2. **Press and hold** the **micro switch** on the *transmitter* until the buzzer starts **beeping intermittently**.
3. **Press and hold** the **micro switch** on the *receiver* to complete the pairing.

Once pairing is successful, the transmitter will emit a **long beep**.
