# Radio Setup

The setup method for each radio controller is different, but generally, you need to set the following points:
1. Enable the PPM input on the trainer port of the radio controller and set the radio controller to 'Master'.
2. Adjust the channels of the radio controller, mapping channels 6, 7, and 8 of the trainer channel to the channels you need.

The axis corresponding to the channel may vary depending on the installation direction of different FPV goggles. You need to test and set your channels according to the actual movement direction.
