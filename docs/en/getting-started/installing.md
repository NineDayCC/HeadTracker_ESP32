# Installation

## Transmitter

For video goggles with Type-C power output, the head tracker transmitter can **be directly plugged into the Type-C port** to work.

You can use a Type-C to Type-C cable to connect your phone to the video goggles. Check if the phone shows it is charging to determine if there is power output.

## Receiver

The installation method for different remote controllers may vary.

Some remote controllers can place the receiver **inside the battery compartment**, sharing the 2s battery with the remote controller.  

For remote controllers with limited space, you need to choose other methods such as external mounting and power supply according to the available space.
